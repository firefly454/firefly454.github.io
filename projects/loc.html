  <h2>Analyzing the Library of Congress Civil Rights History Project</h2>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  A friend, who works at the Library of Congress (LoC), asked me to play around with some of their archives in order to demonstrate different
  ways their data could be used. I happily agreed, as I recently visited the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. and was AMAZED
  at everything: the history of the origins of the Library of Congress, the exquisite architecture and interior decorating of the
  buildings that compose it, the various exhibits they currently had on display (I particularly loved going through the 
  exhibit on the history of the Civil Rights Act), and so on. So, digging through some of the troves of data in the Library of Congress's
  archives seemed like it'd be quite interesting, to say the least! <br><br>
