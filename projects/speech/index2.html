What people say is important. We remember people by the famous words they said, whether it be Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream", to J.F.K.'s, "Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country." In this day and age, what people say is even more important as everything can be recorded and archived indefinitely. </p>

<p>Analyzing every aspect of a politian's way of speaking is a popular hobby these days. From way back in 2007, when then-Senator Barack Obama was celebrated for his deep and resonant Smoker's voice", to the present day's countless articles attacking or defending Hillary Clinton purely on the basis of her speaking tone, Americans are obsessed with the way our leaders talk.</p>

<p>These previous analyses have only been qualitative. Now, however, we can start taking apart the 2016 POTUS candidates' speech patterns based on quantitative metrics.</p>

                    <center><h3>Methods</h3></center>
                    <p>First, speeches, interviews, responses, statements, and various other first-person dialogues from both Clinton and Trump were collected from various internet sources, in order to create a "speech corpus" for each person. The main text of each speech was collected, as well as each speech's title and date. Each text was then tokenized into separate, distinct words; each word in the text was then stemmed into its root word (e.g. "immigration" gets transformed to its root: "immigr"). Stemming allows us to consider all the variants of a word as identical to one another (e.g. "immigration", "immigrant", "immigrants", and "immigrate" are all basically the same). A dictionary for each candidate was then created, based on all of the unique word roots within each candidate's corpus. Each speech could then be represented as an array, with each element of the array representing a different word root, and the value of each element representing the frequency of that word within the speech. If a word's frequency was above a maximum frequency threshold or below a minimum frequency threshold, then the word was excluded from the analysis. For both of their corpuses, the max and min thresholds were set to 70% and 20%. Such thresholds are useful for filtering out noise, but of course, other max and min values could be chosen. Afterwards, sklearn's K-means clustering algorithm was implemented, with >1000 iterations and >1000 initial cluster centers. Because of the large difference in the number of speeches between the two corpses, 9 clusters were chosen for Clinton while 4 clusters were chosen for Trump. Again, using other values for the number of clusters parameter is possible.</p>

<h4>Creating Clinton's Speech Corpus</h4>
<p>While Hillary Clinton has been in the public eye for many years and thus given many public talks, these transcripts are unfortunately not in a single place. I was able to gather 490 unique transcripts by scraping the following websites:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://clinton3.nara.gov/">Welcome to the White House</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/speeches/page/">HillaryClinton.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.womenspeecharchive.org/women/profile/speech/index.cfm?ProfileID=65&SpeechID=365">Women Speech Archive</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu">The American Presidency Project</a></li>
</ul>

The speeches span from May 31 1969, when she gave the Wellesley College Student Commencement Address, to April 26 2016, when she gave remarks on American manufacturing and improving the economy. However, most of the transcripts come from three distinct periods: First Lady (1993-1997), the 2008 Presidential Election, and the current 2016 Presidential Election. During her tenures as Senator of New York and Secretary of State, I could not find as many publicly available transcripts. However, they are undoubtedly archived somewhere, and will eventually be included into the final results.</p> 

<p>Due to the controversay of using her <a href="https://www.hillaryclinton.com/hillarys-emails-four-sentences/">private email account,</a> the State Department also publicly released nearly 7,000 pages of Clinton's (heavily redacted) emails from her time as Secretary of State. While I did not include these in the current analysis, it would be interesting to compare her private emails to her public statements. What would also be interesting is to
see the transcripts to Hillary Clinton's paid Wall Street speeches, which are still garnering news today (e.g. <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/editorials/ct-hillary-clinton-speeches-goldman-sachs-edit-0429-jm-20160428-story.html">Chicago Tribune: What Hillary Clinton said behind closed doors</a>).</p>

<h4 id="TRUMP">Creating Trump's Speech Corpus</h4>

<p>Like Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump has been a famous and public figure for several years now. Unlike Hillary Clinton, however, Trump is primarily a businessman, and the 2016 Presidential election is his first real foray into the public spotlight. Thus, he has given much less formal speeches than Clinton. I was able to gather 32 unique transcripts of speeches, statements, and interviews given by Trump, ranging from March 2013 to present time. These transcripts came from scraping the following websites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">www.DonaldJTrump.com</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu">The American Presidency Project</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.p2016.org">P2016 Race for the White House</a></li></ul>

<h4>9 Categories of Speech Topics</h4>
<!--


                    <p>All of Clinton's 490 speeches in the corpus are clustered into 9 groups. These groups are found automatically by scikit-learn's k-means clustering algorithm, solely based on the terms in each speech. After running the algorithm 1000 times, with 800 different randomized initial cluster centers, the speeches were found to consistently group into the same 9 categories. By getting the ten most meaningful* terms of each group, I could distinguish the primary topic of each group. These are:</p>-->

<p>
<span id="bigimportantr">History, culture, and honor:</span> <span id="important">imagine, history, cultural, past, White House, honored, celebrate, historic, save, century</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantb">Education:</span> <span id="important">schools, teachers, educated, students, parents, public, child, learn, kids, programs</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantr">Elections & politics:</span> <span id="important">vote, Obama, campaigns, Democrats, election, fight, winning, health, Republican, parties</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantb">Economy:</span> <span id="important">tax, paying, economy, company, energy, college, health, workers, invest</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantr">Iraq War & the Bush Administration:</span>
<span id="important">Iraq, war, military, security, administration, policies, Bush, strategy, threats, government, fail</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantb">Healthcare reform:</span> <span id="important">health, health care, insurance, costs, plans, hospital, medical,reform, doctors, nurses</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantr">Peace & security:</span><span id="important"> peace, security, United States, developments, efforts, threats, attack, regions, government, partner</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantb">Domestic & social issues:</span><span id="important"> parents, child, schools, mother, violence, young people, programs, health, problems, read</span><br>


<span id="bigimportantr">Democracy & human rights:
</span> <span id="important">democracies, human, society, human right, girls, government, educated, unites, conferences, voice, economic</span></p>
<!--
<p>*"lot", "got", "DR", and "let" were not considered to have any meaning, and therefore not included in defining each cluster theme, despite some of these terms being in the top ten most important words for the Domestic & social issues cluster, Economy cluster, and Elections & politics cluster.</p>

<h4>Looking at Clinton's speech topics through the years</h4>

<p>By plotting each speech in a scatterplot, with the speech date on the x-axis and the speech category on the y-axis, we can visualize how Clinton's speech topics change with time. The lines distinguish the different roles Hillary Clinton had at different time periods: First Lady of the White House (January 1993 to January 2001), New York State Senator (January 2001 to January 2007), 2008 Presidential Election candidate (January 2007 - June 2008), Secretary of State (January 2009 - Febraury 2013), and 2016 Presidential Election candidate (April 2015 - present). </p>

<p>We can look at a single speech topic, and then go across the plot to see how often she speaks about that topic.
For example, <span id="blue">Healthcare reform</span> was a very important issue for Hillary Clinton when she was First Lady and chair of the taskforce devising the Clinton health care plan of 1993, i.e. Hillarycare. This topic was also important during the 2008 POTUS election, when both she and then-senator Barack Obama both spoke at length of the need for healthcare reform. In contrast, healthcare reform is an issue Hillary Clinton does not talk at all about in the current 2016 POTUS election. The Affordable Care Act is already in effect, so healthcare reform is not an important issue in this election for a democratic candidate like Clinton.</p>

<p><span id="important">Hover over any speech topic on the left side of the figure below, to get a fuller description of the topic, an explanation of how its frequency has changed with time, and excerpts from speeches clustered within that topic.</span></p>-->

<h4>2016 Election Hot Issues</h4>

<p>We can count the number of times Clinton uses words or phrases specific to a particular topic, as a proxy for how important that topic is to her. If we divide the number of times a word is spoken during a speech by the total number of words in that speech, we get that word's "percent useage". Let's look at how different words' percent useages change with time.</p>

<h4>4 Categories of Speech Topics</h4>

<p>Clustering Donald Trump's transcripts, in this project, is difficult for a few reasons. First, he really has only publicly spoken in the past 2 years, and 99% (if not 100%) of these speeches and interviews are related to the 2016 presidential election. For instance, some of the most frequent terms he uses contain his campaign slogan and words like: "poll", "campaign", "president", "support", and "New Hampshire". So, we have to group this already quite similar group of talks into more distinct sub-groups. After running scikit-learn's k-means clustering algorithm 3000 times, with 2000 different randomized initial cluster centers and 4 groups, the most meaningful* terms were analyzed in order to create the following speech categories:</p> 

<p><span id="bigimportantr">Immigration & workers</span> <span id="important">Immigration, workers, foreign, program, American, highly, ending, report, rates, percent</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantb">Stuff:</span> <span id="important">very, know, people, because, look, like, right, happening, many, meaning</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantr">Conservative stuff:</span> <span id="important">life, Ted, issued, conservative, woman, lie, National, courts, person, position</span><br>

<span id="bigimportantb">American border:</span> <span id="important">American, border, people, family, time, very, polling, China, state, government</span></p>


<p>*"don't" and "I've" were not considered to have any meaning, and therefore not included in defining each cluster theme, despite being in the top ten most important words for the "Stuff" category</p>

<h4>How do Trump's speech topics change with time?</h4>
<p>Because the timespan of the speeches in Trump's corpus is very short, with the oldest speech dating back to only March 15, 2013, it is not informative to see how the topics change with time. If Donald Trump remains politically active, however, then this will obviously change!</p>
