        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a> website has many datasets pertaining obviously
        to labor statistics - in particular, the main subjects are: 
        <ul>
        <li>Inflation and Prices</li>
        <li>Employment & Unemployment</li>
        <li>Pay & Benefits</li>
        <li>Spending & Time Use</li>
        <li>Productivity</li>
        <li>Workplace Injuries</li>
        <li>International</li>
        <li>Regional Resources</li>
        </ul>
        
        There are lots and lots of data files on the website (it IS a government statistics organization, after all), for any 
        data junkie to be quite happy with. However, these are 
        maddeningly horrific and ugly files! While some of the datasets are in relatively clean Microsoft Excel
        format, the majority are either contained in tables within PDF files, or in easy-to-parse but very cryptic plain text
        files.<br><br>
        
        <h3>2014 Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries</h3>
        For the first part of this section, I'll give an example of working with one of the BLS's pdf files. I will investigate
        Workplace Injuries, specifically focusing on the number of different types of fatalities in each industry. The primary
        file is "cftb0286.pdf", and can be found <a href="http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm">here</a>, under 
        "2014 Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (preliminary data) - 
        Industry by event or exposure, 2014 (PDF 272K)".<br><br>
   
      Here is the first page of the 35-page document:<br><br>
      <img src="bls_images/bls_fatalities_p1.png" alt="BLS pdf example 1" width="95%"><br><br>

      <h3>What is wrong with these images??</h3>
      <ul><li><strong>"Total" column is unclear</strong></li></ul>
      If you look closely, you can see some quirky things with the data. So many quirky things... 
      First, we can see that the table has 9 primary columns: Industry; NAICS code; Total fatal injuries; Violence and other
      injuries by persons or animals; Transportation incidents; Fires and explosions; Falls, slips, trips; Exposure to
      harmful substances or environments; and Contact wiht objects and equipment. NAICS stands for the North American
      Industry Classification System, and is just the numeric code for each industry/sub-industry/etc. Based on the name, I would assume "Total" 
      to be the sum (or total) of the last 6 columns that give the various fatality causes. However, we can
      very quickly see that this is not the case, if you look at the first example and the rows for Soybean farming, Wheat farming,
      Corn farming, Rice farming, etc. What total is, then, is quite cryptic. 
      
      <ul><li><strong>Hierarchical relationship between industries</strong></li></ul>
      Second, we see that there are varying levels of industries within the table, with levels differentiated by the amount of
      indentation in the industry field name as well as the number of digits in the NAICS code field. We can see this in the first example,
      where Crop production contains Oilseed and grain
      farming, and Oilseed and grain farming contains Soybean farming, Wheat farming, Corn farming, Rice farming, and Other grain farming, and so on. 
      I would expect that the sub-industries numbers should add up to make the priamary industry's numbers, but 
      this is not the case. If we look at the 4th example, we see that Executive, legislative, and other general government support
      has 4 total deaths, while its sub-industry, Public finance activities, has just 1 total death. We can see this same issue throughout all
      of the images, and in the entire original pdf table. By including every row, we may inadvertently be double-counting. Additionally, we
      should only make comparisons within the same industry hierarchical level. It would not make sense to compare the entire Natural
      resources and mining industry with the sub-sector Sugar beet farming.
      
      <ul><li><strong>Many duplicated rows</strong></li></ul>
      Third, there are numerous duplicated rows. In the 4th example, the Public administration row is repeated twice. 
      In that same example, the Executive, legislative,
      and other general government support rows are almost identical, except for a slight difference in the NAICS number. While these rows
      occur next to one another, we also see duplicates occurring across different pages. For example, we see Utilities; Electric power
      generation, transmission, and distribution; Electric power generation; Water, sewage and other systems, etc. rows occurring first on
      page 12 and then page 31. In this case, the NAICS numbers are identical, while the actual death figures are different.
      This occurs dozens of throughout the document. How do we deal with such inconsistencies?

        <ul><li><strong>PDF... really?!</strong></li></ul>
      Fourth, parsing a pdf in python (or in any language) is not straight-forward. 
     A pdf is just a stable, static image that prints easily, and is not meant for text/number extraction. 
     However, I don't want to print the document - I want the 
      information in a nice, tidy format, preferably a python Pandas dataframe! While there are a few python libraries as well as stand-alone websites that
      claim to do pdf parsing, I didn't have too much luck with what I tried, with information not getting parsed correctly.
      
      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      The most important thing is that we are aware of these issues, particularly points 1-3. We can use the Total column, and just 
      keep in mind that the
      different fatality categories do not necessarily add up to 'Total', for whatever reason. For point 2, I will just look at
      the sub-sector level, which corresonds to rows that have 3-digit NAICS codes. This is the most general level described in the
      table, and works well for giving a correspondingly general view of workplace fatalities. Point 3 is mostly fixed by only using
      sub-sector levels. However, when we still have identical sub-sector levels in the table, I will just input both, and keep this in mind for any
      specific, future analysis (for example, use the mean values). And for the fourth point...
      
      <h3>Transforming data from PDF tables to Pandas dataframes</h3>
      
      So, I did something (maybe) a little funny for this. I copy and pasted each table from the pdf file into my favorite text editor (Sublime Text).
      Is there a better way to do this? Probably. But considering I don't normally deal with pdf's, and maybe will never have to again after
      this exercise, the relatively dumb way is faster in the short-run. The result of this was that
       each row of the table was correctly placed into its own line in the text file. I then saved the file as a normal text file, and then
      opened up Jupyter Notebook (formally Ipython Notebook), to do the rest of the data munging and analysis. <br><br>
      
      Here, I'm opening the file ("fatalities.txt") and appending each line into an array.
      
<pre>
def open_file():
        with open("fatalities.txt", "r") as ins:
                array = []
                for line in ins:
                        array.append(line)
        return array
</pre><br>
        
        However, there are lots of issues: 
        <ul>
                <li>Each row of the table is just one big entry in the array. I want to break down each
        row correctly, so that "industry", "naics code", "total fatal injuries", "violence", "transportation", "fires", "exposure",
        and "contact" are all placed in their cells/columns</li>
                <li>We need to get rid of extraneous whitespace characters</li>
                <li>The original PDF table uses "--" to signify the number 0 - let's fix this</li>
                <li>Everything is a string - let's change the numeric values into integers</li>
                <li>As mentioned before, the original PDF contains duplicated rows - let's get rid of these</li>
                
        </ul> 
        <pre>
def open_file():
    with open("fatalities.txt", "r") as ins:
        array = []
        for line in ins:
            array.append(line)
    return array

def clean_up(array):
    for line_num,line in enumerate(array):
        line = array[line_num].strip("\n")      # Remove newline character
        if "--" in line:                        # Change "--" to 0
            line = re.sub("--", "0", line)
        array[line_num] = line
    return array
    
def create_df(array):
    industry=[]
    naics=[]
    total=[]
    violence=[]
    transportation=[]
    fires=[]
    falls=[]
    exposure=[]
    contact=[]
    
    regex = re.compile("[A-Za-z(]")

    for line_num,line in enumerate(array):
        words = line.split()
        linetitle = []            
        for w in words:
            if regex.match(w[0]):
                words = words[1:]
                linetitle.append(w)
                industry_row=' '.join(linetitle)
        for w_num,w in enumerate(words):
            words[w_num]=w.replace(",","")      # remove commas in numbers
        if len(words)==8:                       # NAICS code is non-blank entry
            if len(words[0])==3:                # NAICS code is 3-digits, meaning sub-sector level
                industry.append(industry_row)
                naics.append(int(words[0]))
                total.append(int(words[1]))
                violence.append(int(words[2]))
                transportation.append(int(words[3]))
                fires.append(int(words[4]))
                falls.append(int(words[5]))
                exposure.append(int(words[6]))
                contact.append(int(words[7]))
                last_industry_name = industry_row
                
    # Create pandas dataframe object from dictionary
    d={'industry':industry,
       'naics': naics,
       'total': total,
       'violence': violence,
       'transportation': transportation,
       'fires': fires,
       'falls': falls,
       'exposure': exposure,
       'contact': contact}
    df = pd.DataFrame(d)
    cols = ['industry','naics','total','violence','transportation','fires','falls','exposure','contact']
    df = df[cols]
    return df
        </pre>
        
        Ok! That was not so bad, actually, and now we have a very nice dataframe that looks like this:<br><br>
        
        <img src="bls_images/bls_df.png" alt="dataframe head" width="95%"><br><br>
        
        We can also create
        some helper functions, in order to:
        <ul>
                <li>Create new features, such as the percent of all fatalities for an industry that are
                due to violence (i.e. divide 'violence' column by 'total' column. NOTE: the original
                data is quite messy, such that some rows have 0 'total' fatalities but non-zero entries
                for specific categories - in those cases, we will insert a NaN rather than an Inf</li>
                <li>Plot date in the same format</li>
        </ul>
        
        <pre>
def modify_df(df):
    df['violenceP']=df.violence/df.total
    df['transportationP']=df.transportation/df.total
    df['firesP']=df.fires/df.total
    df['fallsP']=df.falls/df.total
    df['exposureP']=df.exposure/df.total
    df['contactP']=df.contact/df.total
    df=df.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], np.nan)   # replace any inf values with nan values
    return df

def create_barchart(df,column_name,num,title_string):
    tempdf=df.sort_values(by=column_name,ascending=False)[0:num]
    tempdff=tempdf[['industry','violence','transportation','fires','falls','exposure','contact']]
    tempdff=tempdff.set_index('industry')
    a=tempdff.index
    ax=tempdff.plot.barh(stacked=True,figsize=(8, 6),title=title_string);
    labels = [ '\n'.join(wrap(l, 37)) for l in a ]
    ax.set_xlabel("# of deaths")
    ax.set_yticklabels(labels)
    fig=ax.get_figure()
    return fig
        </pre>
     <div id="final_pictures">
     <h3>Exploratory analysis time!</h3>
     
     Now that that's all done, let's see some pictures! Pandas is so great in that we can create
     plots directly from dataframes, rather than using matplotlib or seaborn. Here are a few images:<br><br><br>
     <!--
     <h4>Top 10 sub-sectors with most fatalities, 2014</h4>
     
     This bar chart contains the top 10 sub-sectors with the most fatalities in 2014, with each bar colored by the 6
     different fatality causes. 
     Fatality causes are abbreviated as follows:
     <ul>
             <li>Violence and other injuries by persons or animals: "Violence"</li>
             <li>Transportation incidents: "Transportation"</li>
             <li>Fires and explosions: "Fires"</li>
             <li>Falls, slips, trips: "Falls"</li>
             <li>Exposure to harmful substances or environments: "Exposure"</li>
             <li>Contact with objects and equipment: "Contact"</li>
     </ul>
     Service providing had the most fatalities in that year, with ~2250 deaths. Of these
     deaths, the majority were caused by transportation. Indeed, transportation was the leading cause of workplace fatalities in
     many of the top sub-sectors. Only Construction of buildings, Administrative and support services, and
     Specialty trade contractors differed from this trend, with 
     falls as all of their leading causes of death.<br><br>
     
     <img src="bls_images/total_top10.png" alt="top 10 total fatalities, non-specific industries" width="80%">
     
      <h4>Top 10 sub-sectors with most VIOLENT fatalities, 2014</h4>
     This bar chart shows the top 10 specific industries with the most fatalities caused by Violence, in 2014. Unsurprisingly,
     Justice, public order, and safety activities had the most violent fatalities. <br><br>
     <img src="bls_images/violence_top10.png" alt="top 10 total fatalities, non-specific industries" width="80%">
     
    <h4>Top 10 sub-sectors with highest VIOLENT fatalities by proportion, 2014</h4>
     We can also look at a bar chart that shows the top 10 specific industries with the highest PROPORTION of fatalities caused by 
     Violence, in 2014. <br><br>
     <img src="bls_images/violenceP_top10.png" alt="top 10 violenceP fatalities, specific industries" width="80%">
     
     <h4>Top 10 sub-sectors with >20 total deaths AND highest VIOLENT fatalities by proportion, 2014</h4>
     If we look at the x-axis in the above plot, we see that the actual total number of deaths for many of the sub-sectors is quite small. So, while these
     industries' fatalities have a high percentage of fatalities caused by violence, it would be misleading to say that these industries are actually violent. Let's
     filter the data by only including industries that have at least 20 total deaths, to get the next plot. Here, we see that many of the
     industries that have a high proportion of deaths due to violence are quite similar. The top 4 industries with the
     highest proportion of violent deaths are: Gasoline stations, Food and beverage stores, Miscellaneous store retailers, and Food services
     and drinking places. Interestingly, Professional, scientific, and techinical services ranked #9 for most violent fatalities by
     proportion.<br><br>

     <h3>Conclusion and... what next?</h3>
     I showed how one can parse a multi-page table in a pdf file, and how one can produce some pretty images quite easily with the
     resulting pandas dataframes. Specifically, I also showed how the original pdf table from the Buraeu of Labor Statistics is somewhat
     messy and requires a bit of understanding the material before one can delve in. However, there is so much more we can do with this data! Next steps in the project are:
     <ul>
             <li>Create interactive plots or dashboards, so that users can select whichever variables and filters they wish to see,
             rather than just being limited to only the static figures I choose to display.</li>
             <li>Getting other datasets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to create a richer analysis. For example,
             if we include a dataset that contains total employment numbers in 2014 for each industry, then we could look at
             the percentages of employees, rather than the absolute number of employees, that
             incur workplace fatalities (as the latter is
             somewhat meaningless when we do not have a sense of how many employees there are in total).</li>
     </ul>
     Stay tuned, and thanks for reading! <br><br>
