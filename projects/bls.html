        <h1>Working with data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, part 1</h1>
        <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> website has many datasets pertaining obviously
        to labor statistics - in particular, the main subjects are: 
        <ul>
        <li>Inflation and Prices</li>
        <li>Employment & Unemployment</li>
        <li>Pay & Benefits</li>
        <li>Spending & Time Use</li>
        <li>Productivity</li>
        <li>Workplace Injuries</li>
        <li>International</li>
        <li>Regional Resources</li>
        </ul>
        
        However, these are horfifically ugly files! While some of the datasets are in relatively clean Microsoft excel
        format, the majority are either contained in tables in PDF files (!), or in easy-to-parse but very cryptic plain text
        files.<br>
        
        For the first part of this section, I'll give an example of working with one of the BLS's pdf files. I will investigate
        Workplace Injuries, specifically focusing on the number of different types of fatalities in each industry. The primary
        file is "cftb0286.pdf", and can be found in <a href="http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshcfoi1.htm">here</a>, under 
        "2014 Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (preliminary data) - 
        Industry by event or exposure, 2014 (PDF 272K)".<br>
   
      Here is the first page of the 35-page document:
