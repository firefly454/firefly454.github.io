        <h1>My projects</h1>
        <p>For the past few months, I've been enrolled in Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree program. The following are some of the 
        projects I've worked on, as part of the nanodegree requirements.</p>
        <li><a href="/projects/EDA2.html">Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis of Historical Loans</a><br>
        This report contains an exploratory analysis of loan data from Prosper. <a href="https://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> is 
        a peer-to-peer lending marketplace in which prospective borrowers post loan listings while investors select specific 
        listings to then invest in. Investors can select loans based on a variety of factors, such as: the loan amount, the loan 
        rating, the borrower’s salary, or the borrower’s number of past inquiries. 
        I investigated this dataset (which ranged from 2006 - 2014) using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, and discovered interesting 
        relationships between various variables. I also created many beautiful, informative, and revealing plots using the 
        awesome ggplot library.
                </li><br><br>
        My favorite images from the report:<br>

        The above figure is the first plot in this report. 
        It is important because it is a clear example of how Prosper drastically changed much of its loan servicing 
        procedures in 2009. In my original, first-pass analysis of the Prosper loan data, I included every single loan. 
        However, I soon realized that there were distinct differences in loans based on whether they originated before or 
        after 2009. For example, the Prosper rating variables (“ProsperRating [numeric]” and “ProsperRating [Alpha]”), as 
        well as “EstimatedEffectiveYield”, “EstimatedLoss”, and “EstimatedReturn”, are only applicable for loans originating 
        in July 2009 (i.e. in Q3 2009) or later. In contrast, “CreditGrade” is only applicable for loans originating in 2008 or 
        earlier.

        In this figure, we can see that servicing fee (a new variable that I created) was originally a variable rate prior to 
        2009, and then became fixed at a set rate of 5% afterwards. This figure visibly demonstrates, and therefore justifies, 
        that the loans in the Prosper dataset should be separated into two groups: those originating either prior to Q3 2009, 
        or in/after Q3 2009. <br>

        <li><a href="/projects/OpenStreetMap_with_MongoDB.html">Project 3: OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling</a><br>
        I imported information on Cambridge, England from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. I first checked 
        the dataset for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity, and then cleaned up all of the problems 
        I found. I then exported the cleaned dataset into a MongoDB database. I queried this new database, asking and answering 
        questions like, what are the top 10 amenities in Cambridge, or which pubs serve cask/real ale? Everything was coded in 
        python (using Ipython Notebook).
