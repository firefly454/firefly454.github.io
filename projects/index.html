        <li><a href="/projects/EDA2.html">Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis of Historical Loans</a><br>
        This report contains an exploratory analysis of loan data from Prosper. <a href="https://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> is 
        a peer-to-peer lending marketplace in which prospective borrowers post loan listings while investors select specific 
        listings to then invest in. Investors can select loans based on a variety of factors, such as: the loan amount, the loan 
        rating, the borrower’s salary, or the borrower’s number of past inquiries. 
        I investigated this dataset (which ranged from 2006 - 2014) using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, and discovered interesting 
        relationships between various variables. I also created many beautiful, informative, and revealing plots using the 
        awesome ggplot library.

        <li>Project 3: OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling<br>
        I imported information on Cambridge, England from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. I first checked 
        the dataset for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity, and then cleaned up all of the problems 
        I found. I then exported the cleaned dataset into a MongoDB database. I queried this new database, asking and answering 
        questions like, what are the top 10 amenities in Cambridge, or which pubs serve cask/real ale? Everything was coded in 
        python (using Ipython Notebook).
