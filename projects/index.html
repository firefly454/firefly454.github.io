        <h1>My projects</h1>
        For the past few months, I've been enrolled in Udacity's Data Analyst nanodegree program. The following are some of the 
        projects I've worked on, as part of the nanodegree requirements.
        
        <h2><a href="/projects/project_5_writeup(1).html">Project 5: Enron Persons-of-Interest Fraud Classifier</a></h2>
       The Enron scandal, which was revealed in 2001 and led to the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation in 2002, remains one of the largest cases of corporate fraud in American history. In the ensuing Federal investigation, thousands of emails, detailed financial data, and other normally confidential information became part of the public record. Among the hundreds of employees at Enron and related companies, a few handful were either: 

        - indicted
        - reached a settlement or entered a plea agreement with the government
        - testified in exchange for prosecution immunity. 

        The purpose of this project is to classify actual Enron employees as being or not being "persons of interest" ("POIs"), i.e. among the few that did one of the above actions, using data made public from the investigation.
        
        <h2><a href="/projects/project4page.html">Project 4: Exploratory Data Analysis of Historical Loans</a></h2>
        
        This report contains an exploratory analysis of loan data from Prosper. <a href="https://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> is 
        a peer-to-peer lending marketplace in which prospective borrowers post loan listings while investors select specific 
        listings to then invest in. Investors can select loans based on a variety of factors, such as: the loan amount, the loan 
        rating, the borrower’s salary, or the borrower’s number of past inquiries. 
        I investigated this dataset (which ranged from 2006 - 2014) using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, and discovered interesting 
        relationships between various variables. I also created many beautiful, informative, and revealing plots using the 
        awesome ggplot library.<br><br>
               
        <h2><a href="/projects/OpenStreetMap_with_MongoDB.html">Project 3: OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling</a></h2>
        
        I imported information on Cambridge, England from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. I first checked 
        the dataset for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity, and then cleaned up all of the problems 
        I found. I then exported the cleaned dataset into a MongoDB database. I queried this new database, asking and answering 
        questions like, what are the top 10 amenities in Cambridge, or which pubs serve cask/real ale? Everything was coded in 
        python (using Ipython Notebook).
