        This report contains an exploratory analysis of loan data from Prosper. <a href "www.prosper.com">Prosper</a> is a peer-to-peer lending marketplace in which prospective borrowers post loan listings while investors select specific listings to then invest in. Investors can select loans based on a variety of factors, such as: the loan amount, the loan rating, the borrower’s salary, or the borrower’s number of past inquiries. 
        I investigated this dataset using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, and discovered interesting relationships between various variables. I also created many beautiful, informative, and revealing plots using the awesome ggplot library.
