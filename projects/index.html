        This report contains an exploratory analysis of loan data from Prosper. <a href="https://www.prosper.com/">Prosper</a> is a peer-to-peer lending marketplace in which prospective borrowers post loan listings while investors select specific listings to then invest in. Investors can select loans based on a variety of factors, such as: the loan amount, the loan rating, the borrower’s salary, or the borrower’s number of past inquiries. 
        I investigated this dataset using R and exploratory data analysis techniques, and discovered interesting relationships between various variables. I also created many beautiful, informative, and revealing plots using the awesome ggplot library.

        <li>Project 3: OpenStreetMap Data Wrangling<br>
        I imported information on Cambridge, England from <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>. After checking the dataset for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency, and uniformity, and subsequently cleaning up problems found in the data, I then exported the data into a MongoDB database. I queried this new database, asking and answering questions like, what are the top 10 amenities in Cambridge, and which pubs serve cask/real ale? Everything was coded in python (using an Ipython Notebook).
