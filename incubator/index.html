<h1>Data Incubator Application - Project Proposal</h1>

<h3>Description and Proposal</h3>
<p>I propose to generate a corpus containing speeches, newspaper editorials, interview answers, and so on, labelled by
their speakers/writers. With a large enough corpus, I can use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to quickly cluster the
texts into groups. These groups may reveal surprising connections between different people. However, it would be even more interesting to take new texts - the political speeches of current 
presidential candidates, in particular - and see which cluster each falls into. We could ask AND answer questions like: Is
Donald Trump's rhetoric geometrically closer to that of Mother Theresa or Adolf Hitler? As many famous figures give
many speeches, I also propose to work with people's individual corpuses. We could then see what the major themes
are that create each cluster, and thus are seemingly most important
to that person (assuming a politican's talk is genuine). By including the speech's date as a variable, we could even
create a timeline showing how themes change with respect to time.
Again, current political candidates' speeches would be ideal for
such a project - they talk a lot, as well as flip-flop a lot, and
using a computer to figure out what they supposedly care about is much easier and more enjoyable than listening to all 
of that talk!</p>
<p>This project would be interesting to the general public, as it involves famous, notable people, both villainous and
(literally) saintly, as well as current politicans. It could even be interactive, by allowing a user to upload something
they have written (or any piece of text not in the corpus) and then returning a list of the closest speakers and speeches/texts 
as well as the most common, important words that led to how the user's text was clustered. Having interesting, interactive visualizations of the relationships between their text and
the famous words of others would engage users as well</p>

<h3>Initial Data Source</h3>
<p>In order to get transcripts of famous speeches, I used Python's BeautifulSoup to scrape <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/top100speechesall.html">
AmericanRhetoric.com</a>. The primary webpage contained links to sub-pages, with each sub-page containing the transcript of a single
speech.</p>

<h3>First Plot</h3>
<p> After creating a corpus of all of the speech transcripts, I created a bag-of-words representation of the text, with word stemming,
stop word filtering, and term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Each speech could then be represented as a 
vector, with each element representing the frequency of a particular word stem. I then calculated the distances
between all pairs of speeches (using cosine similarity), and used those distances for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward%27s_method">Ward's method</a> for
hierarchical clustering, resulting in the following dendogram plot.</p>

<p>We can see that there are about 2 relatively large primary clusters (in red and teal) and 1 very tiny primary 
cluster (in green). If we look closely at the low-level clusters, we see some intuitive patterns
and some not-so-intuitive patterns. For example, William Jefferson Clinton (i.e. Bill Clinton) and
Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton are paired together, despite their seemingly different speech
topics (Bill's speech is called <i>Oklahoma Bombing Memorial Address</i>, while Hillary's is 
<i>Women's Rights are Human Rights</i>). J.F.K.'s <i>Cuban Missile Crisis Address</i> is paired
up with Dwight D. Eisenhouwer's <i>Atoms for Peace</i>. Interestingly, the closest speech to
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s <i>I have a Dream</i> is J.F.K.'s 
<i>Ich bin ein Berliner</i>. Admittedly, I do not know the content of J.F.K.'s speech - 
only the anecdote that the title actually translates something to <i>I am a jelly-filled
donut</i> - however, I am now curious to read the transcript, and see if it is as inspiring
and powerful as <i>I have a Dream</i>. Another surprise is that Nixon's resignation speech
is closest to JFK's Inaugural address.</p>

<h3>Second Plot</h3>
This plot relies on the distances that were used in the first plot. Basically, all of the speeches are along the
x-axis and the y-axis, such that the (i,j)-th cell corresponds to the distance between the ith and jth speech. So,
all of the cells along the diagonal have distance=0, since the distance between a speech and itself is zero. All of
the other pairs have non-zero distances. What is interesting about this plot is that we can clearly see that there
are some speeches that are extremely different from practically every other speech - this phenomenon is what gives us
the dark red horizontal and vertical bands. We can see that these speeches are the same speeches in the lonely bottom, green
branch of the dendogram plot above. The speeches that are outliers are:
<ul>
  <li>JFK's <i>Civil Rights Address</i></li>
  <li>Lou Gehrig's <i>Farewell to Baseball Address</i> (not so surprising this is an outlier)</li>
  <li>Gerald Ford's <i>National Address Pardoning Richard M. Nixon</i></li>
  <li>Joseph N Welch's <i>Have You No Sense of Decency</i> (ditto)</li>
  <li>William Jennings Bryan's <i>Against Imperialism</i></li>
  <li>Edward Moore Kennedy's <i>1980 DNC Address</i></li>
</ul>
Obviously, this is something that I'd want to investigate more, and see if this
phenomenon is real, but as a first pass, this seems very interesting.

<h3>Third Plot</h3>
<p>Another way to group the speeches is by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">
  k-means clustering</a>, which is quite good for sparse and unstructured data. One of the parameters for scikit-learn's
  k-means clustering algorithm is the number of clusters - I made an initial choice of 8 clusters, but with more time and
  further refining of the project, I would definitely experiment with other cluster numbers. The following figure shows
  the different speeches, colored by which cluster they belong to. The top 5 words that are nearest to each cluster's centroid
  are also given, at the bottom left. Additionally, the x,y-coordinates of each speech are the result of multi-dimensional
  scaling (MDS), which allows one to represent
  the distance matrix with a lower-dimensional form whilst still somewhat preserving the distances in the original
  high-dimensional space.
</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about this plot, other than the fact that k-means clustering gives
slightly different results than Ward's method, is the top 7 words for each cluster. Note that
the top 7 words are in their stemmed form, thus "peace" showing up as its stem, "peac".
We can see some
cool patterns here. For example, the 2nd cluster's top 5 words are: "war,
peac, militari, power, unit, state, presid". Speeches that
are grouped into this cluster are denoted by maroon dots, and include: 
<ul>
  <li>Franklin Delano Roosevelt: <i>Pearl Harbor Address to the Nation</i></li>
  <li>George Catlett Marshall: <i>The Marshall Plan</i></li>
  <li>Gen. Douglas MacArthur: <i> Farewell Address to Congress</i></li>
  <li>Harry S. Truman: <i>The Truman Doctrine</i></li>
  <li>Thomas Woodrow Wilson: <i>War Message</i></li>
  <li>Rabert Marion La Follette: <i>Free Speech in Wartime</i></li>
  <li>Lyndon Baines Johnson: <i>On Vietnam</i></li>
</ul>

In contrast, the 4rd cluster's top 5 words
are "women, woman, vote, law, war, parti, half." Of the 6 speeches in this cluster,
3 are by suffrage leaders (Carrie Chapman Catt and Anna Howard Shaw), 1 is by birth control activist and
feminist Margaret Sanger, and 1 is Hillary Clinton's <i>Women's Rights are Human Rights</i>. 
Interestingly, the 5th speech is Bill Clinton's <i>Oklahoma Bombing Memorial Address</i>, which has
nothing to do with the generally feminist topics of the former speeches.
</ul>

<h2>A few words...</h2>
  <p>These figures are definitely exploratory in nature. First of all, the corpus I generated is relatively small,
  consisting of ~100 speeches. I definitely would increase this, with more web scraping. Second of all, the plots
  are not the best-formatted. I am learning d3.js and dipmle.js right now, and would love to use those tools, 
  instead of python, to
  create pretty, interactive data visualizations! </p>
