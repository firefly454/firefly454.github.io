<h1>Data Incubator Application - Project Proposal</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>


<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>In order to get transcripts of famous speeches, I used Python's BeautifulSoup to scrape <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/top100speechesall.html">
AmericanRhetoric.com</a>. The primary webpage contained links to sub-pages, with each sub-page containing the transcript of a single
speech.</p>

<h3>First Plot</h3>
<p> After creating a corpus of all of the speech transcripts, I created a bag-of-words representation of the text, with word stemming,
stop word filtering, and term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Each speech could then be represented as a 
vector, with each element representing the frequency of a particular word stem. From that, I then calculated the distances
between all pairs of speeches (using cosine similarity), and used those distances for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward%27s_method">Ward's method</a> for
hierarchical clustering, resulting in the following figure.

<h3>Second Plot</h3>
<p>Another way to group the speeches is by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">
  k-means clustering</a>, which is quite good for sparse and unstructured data. One of the parameters for scikit-learn's
  k-means clustering algorithm is the number of clusters - I somewhat randomly chose 8 clusters, but with more time and
  further refining of the project, I would definitely experiment with other cluster numbers. The following figure shows
  the different speeches, colored by which cluster they belong to. The top 5 words that are nearest to each cluster's centroid
  are also given, at the bottom left. Additionally, the x,y-coordinates of each speech are the result of multi-dimensional
  scaling (MDS), which allows one to represent
  the distance matrix with a lower-dimensional form whilst still somewhat preserving the distances in the original
  high-dimensional space.
