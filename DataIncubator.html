<h1>Data Incubator Application - Project Proposal</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>Data Source</h3>
<p>In order to get transcripts of famous speeches, I used Python's BeautifulSoup to scrape <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/top100speechesall.html">
AmericanRhetoric.com</a>. The primary webpage contained links to sub-pages, with each sub-page containing the transcript of a single
speech.</p>

<h3>First Plot</h3>
<p> After creating a corpus of all of the speech transcripts, I created a bag-of-words representation of the text, with word stemming,
stop word filtering, and term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). Each speech could then be represented as a 
vector, with each element representing the frequency of a particular word stem. I then calculated the distances
between all pairs of speeches (using cosine similarity), and used those distances for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward%27s_method">Ward's method</a> for
hierarchical clustering, resulting in the following dendogram plot.</p>

<p>We can see that there are about 2 relatively large primary clusters (in red) and 1 very tiny primary 
cluster (in green). If we look closely at the low-level clusters, we see some intuitive patterns
and some not-so-intuitive patterns. For example, William Jefferson Clinton (i.e. Bill Clinton) and
Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton are paired together, despite their seemingly different speech
topics (Bill's speech is called <i>Oklahoma Bombing Memorial Address</i>, while Hillary's is 
<i>Women's Rights are Human Rights</i>). J.F.K.'s <i>Cuban Missile Crisis Address</i> is paired
up with Dwight D. Eisenhouwer's <i>Atoms for Peace</i>. Interestingly, the closest speech to
Martin Luther King, Jr.'s <i>I have a Dream</i> is J.F.K.'s 
<i>Ich bin ein Berliner</i>. Admittedly, I do not know the content of J.F.K.'s speech - 
only the anecdote that the title actually translates something to <i>I am a jelly-filled
donut</i> - however, I am now curious to read the transcript, and see if it is as inspiring
and powerful as <i>I have a Dream</i>. Another surprise is that Nixon's resignation speech
is closest to JFK's Inaugural address.</p>

<h3>Second Plot</h3>
<p>Another way to group the speeches is by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">
  k-means clustering</a>, which is quite good for sparse and unstructured data. One of the parameters for scikit-learn's
  k-means clustering algorithm is the number of clusters - I made an initial choice of 8 clusters, but with more time and
  further refining of the project, I would definitely experiment with other cluster numbers. The following figure shows
  the different speeches, colored by which cluster they belong to. The top 5 words that are nearest to each cluster's centroid
  are also given, at the bottom left. Additionally, the x,y-coordinates of each speech are the result of multi-dimensional
  scaling (MDS), which allows one to represent
  the distance matrix with a lower-dimensional form whilst still somewhat preserving the distances in the original
  high-dimensional space.
</p>
<p>The most interesting thing about this plot, other than the fact that k-means clustering gives
slightly different results than Ward's method, is the top 7 words for each cluster. Note that
the top 7 words are in their stemmed form, thus "peace" showing up as its stem, "peac".
We can see some
cool patterns here. For example, the 2nd cluster's top 5 words are: "war,
peac, militari, power, unit, state, presid". Speeches that
are grouped into this cluster are denoted by maroon dots, and include: 
<ul>
  <li>Franklin Delano Roosevelt: <i>Pearl Harbor Address to the Nation</i></li>
  <li>George Catlett Marshall: <i>The Marshall Plan</i></li>
  <li>Gen. Douglas MacArthur: <i> Farewell Address to Congress</i></li>
  <li>Harry S. Truman: <i>The Truman Doctrine</i></li>
  <li>Thomas Woodrow Wilson: <i>War Message</i></li>
  <li>Rabert Marion La Follette: <i>Free Speech in Wartime</i></li>
  <li>Lyndon Baines Johnson: <i>On Vietnam</i></li>
</ul>

In contrast, the 4rd cluster's top 5 words
are "women, woman, vote, law, war, parti, half." Of the 6 speeches in this cluster,
3 are by suffrage leaders (Carrie Chapman Catt and Anna Howard Shaw), 1 is by birth control activist and
feminist Margaret Sanger, and 1 is Hillary Clinton's <i>Women's Rights are Human Rights</i>. 
Interestingly, the 5th speech is Bill Clinton's <i>Oklahoma Bombing Memorial Address</i>, which has
nothing to do with the generally feminist topics of the former speeches.
</ul>
