	<h1>About me....</h1>
	<p>I completed my doctoral dissertation on the biomechanics of hummingbird flight in December 2014 
	at the University of California, Berkeley, but am currently working on a career change into data science. 
	I'm excited about data science because it fulfills my sense of curiosity - I enjoy playing with data and 
	figuring out what it means! Prior to my graduate studies, I received a B.A. in Mathematics at New York University.</p>
