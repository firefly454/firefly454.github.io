	<h1>About me....</h1>
	<p>Helloo! I am currently working on a career change into data science - I enjoy playing with data and figuring out
	what it means! Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. on the biomechanics of hummingbird flight
	in December 2014, at the University of California, Berkeley. </p><br><br>
