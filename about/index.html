	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
	I enjoy playing with data and figuring out
	what it means! Prior to this, I had two babies in 2014: 
	<ul>
		<li>
			my biological baby, Ronan, in March 2014
		</li>
		<li>
			my academic baby, a PhD on the biomechanics of hummingbird flight, in December 2014, at the University of California, Berkeley
		</li>
	</ul>

		<li>In my free time, I do <strong>pottery</strong> as a student at the <a href="http://www.pottersguild.net/">
			Ann Arbor Potters Guild
		</a>. I started in September 2015, and am quite obsessed! See some of my work
