	<h1>About me....</h1>
	<p>I enjoy playing with data and figuring out
	what it means! Prior to this, I had two babies in 2014: <br>
	1. my biological baby, Ronan, in March 2014 <br>
	2. my academic baby, a PhD on the biomechanics of hummingbird flight, in December 2014, at the University of California, Berkeley.<br> </p>
